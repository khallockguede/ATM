# ATM

<img src=./ATM.png>

## Description:
<p> This is a simple ATM app. <br> If the user attempts to withdraw more money than is available, the submit button will disable. </p>

## How to Run:
<p> Clone all files to a single folder. <br> Start a local server. </br> Open the "index.html" file and start using the app.</p>

## Future Improvements:
<p> I plan to add extra features like a transaction list. </p>
